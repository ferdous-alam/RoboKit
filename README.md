# RoboKit
*RoboKit* is a robotics library written in python and still in development. It focuses on the screw axis method calculation for robot forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, motion planning, dynamics and control. This is largely built based on the textbook "Modern robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park.
